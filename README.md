# Anywhere Fitness Frontend

Anywhere Fitness is an app meant to empower Fitness Instructors and Clients. 
Instructors can create classes and clients can log in and save classes they wish to join.

When an instructor creates a class they can specify:
 - The name of the class
 - The type of class 
 - The duration
 - The intensity
 - The class capacity
 - The date, time of when it will be held
 - The location of where the class will take place
